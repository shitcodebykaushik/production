# Key terms 
 - http—A library containing the types HttpRequest and HttpResponse. It implements the logic for converting between HTTP requests and responses and corresponding Rust data structures.
 - httpserver—The main web server, which incorporates a main() function, a
socket server, and a handler and router, manages the coordination among them.
It serves as both a web server (serving HTML) and a web service (serving JSON).

 # Difficulties 
 - We are going to build the data structure  to hold AN http REQUEST.t. When
a byte stream comes in over a TCP connection, we will parse it and convert it into
strongly typed Rust data structures for further processing. 

Implementating a Default traits allow us to create a new struct with the struct with the default values as.
# Work progress
 - The connection has been established
 - The iteration two was succesfull
 -  Crgo test was passed without any error.
  - Two test case was passed
  - Three test cases has been passed

 - Now its tym to construct the HTTP response messages.
